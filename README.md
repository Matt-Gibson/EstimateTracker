# EstimateTracker

> A Simple Solution for small Service Based business Estimate Tracking - Me

## Purpose

People forget what they swear they never will, loose those 14+ pieces of paper around the office
and throughout the fleet about every 3 months, and will keep talking about how.. you know...
whats-their-name. There are well over a googol ToDoList and Reminder apps in existance, so
why write my own? Anyone who has ever worked in a trade or office for any amount of time will
come to the understanding of a Domain. Not that one, think less of urls and more... well...

The goal is not to provide some ultimate level of effecient software that everyone has to sit
through training after training for, only to creep closer toward an aneurysm.... but, instead
to practice basic situational awareness and LISTEN TO HOW people already accomplish their
work. Learn the vernacular and the natural workflow and create something that the user can
naturally.... work WITH... not against. Seriously, naming things is the most difficult part
after all.

## Feature List

- CRUD Web Api
- Asynchronus communication between a Blazor WASM frontend/CRUD Web Api and CRUD Web Api/Sqlite DbRepository Service
- Use of a 'List<>' to enumerate over and display our data, once free from the ever suspiciously small Sqlite Database
